# Code Friend (Beta) üòç
A recurring problem these days is that we are always connected and
receiving information in an unbridled way, but the problem of remaining long
periods in this heap of information is that we distance ourselves from human interactions,
This causes serious social and psychological problems.
People who have few social relationships can develop a low empathy,
social fear, loneliness and anxiety.

The proposal of the application is to create an AI as a virtual chat friend, which will advise the
user during recurring problems of the current world situation: Anxiety, depression, and
during the conversations between the user and the APP, he will have available the numbers of
emergencies if you have complained about serious problems (Thoughts on
suicide, etc).

The application is not a "Psychologist", but a tool where the user can
talk about your day to day life, vent and feel heard.
